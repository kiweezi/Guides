# Fix home WiFi

This guide descibes the steps needed to fix the WiFi at home.


## Steps

1. **Unplug** the powerline adapter in the understairs cupboard. It looks like a small white box labeled `TP-Link` with a black ethernet cable coming out the top.
2. **Plug** the powerline adapter back in again.

*Test the WiFi for the next minute. If it still doesn't work, continue to step 3.*

3. **Send a message** to Rhys via **text or iMessage** explaining the issue and what you have done so far.

*If Rhys doesn't respond in 5 minutes, continue to step 4.*

4. **Stop the router** (the box on the floor of the cupboard). Do this by pressing the large button on the back, once to turn it off.
5. After 1 minute, **start the router**. Do this by pressing the same large button on the back once, again.
