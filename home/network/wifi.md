# Fix home WiFi

This guide descibes the steps needed to fix the WiFi at home.


## Steps

1. Unplug the small white box labeled TP-Link with a black ethernet cable coming out the top.
2. Plug this box back in again.

*Test the WiFi for the next minute. If it still doesn't work, continue to step 3.*

3. Send a message to Rhys explaining the issue and what you have done so far.

*If Rhys doesn't respond in 5 minutes, continue to step 4.*

4. Stop the router (the box on the floor of the cupboard). Do this by clicking the large button on the back, once to turn it off.
5. After 1 minute, start the router. Do this by clicking the same large button on the back once, again.

*If the WiFi still doesn't work, wait for Rhys to respond.*
